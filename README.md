<h1>Deep Q-Learning for Lunar Landing</h1>
<br>

This project demonstrates the application of Deep Q-Learning to solve the classic Lunar Lander environment, where the goal is to safely land a lunar module in a controlled manner. Using reinforcement learning and a neural network, we train an agent to master the lunar landing task by maximizing cumulative rewards over episodes. <br>

**Project Overview**
The notebook implements Deep Q-Learning using PyTorch to train an agent to successfully navigate the Lunar Lander environment, which requires both precision and strategic action selection. The project involves setting up a neural network architecture, implementing experience replay for memory, training the agent over multiple episodes, and visualizing the results. <br>

**Key Steps**
<li>Setting Up Environment and Dependencies: The project utilizes OpenAI's Gymnasium to create the Lunar Lander environment and PyTorch for building and training the neural network.</li>

<li>Building the Neural Network: The network architecture consists of fully connected layers, designed to take the current state of the environment as input and output Q-values for each possible action.</li>

<li>Hyperparameter Initialization: Key parameters like learning rate, batch size, discount factor, and epsilon for exploration-exploitation trade-off are set to optimize training.</li>

<li>Experience Replay: A replay memory stores experiences, which are later sampled to train the agent. This method improves stability and helps the agent learn from a variety of past actions.</li>

<li>Implementing the DQN Agent: The agent interacts with the environment, selects actions based on an epsilon-greedy policy, and uses the Q-learning algorithm to update its action-value function.</li>

<li>Training the Agent: Over a set number of episodes, the agent learns to maximize its reward by updating its Q-values based on its experiences in the environment.</li>

<li>Visualizing Performance: The trained agent's performance is visualized by displaying video recordings of its actions, allowing us to observe the modelâ€™s ability to complete a successful landing.</li>
<br>

**Applications**
This project showcases how Deep Q-Learning can be applied to reinforcement learning problems that involve sequential decision-making, such as robotic control, navigation, and gaming. The approach can be adapted for various real-world applications requiring autonomous action selection under uncertainty. <br>

**Requirements**
This project requires Python libraries including gymnasium, torch, numpy, and imageio. These libraries enable simulation, neural network training, and visualization. <br>

**Summary**
The project provides an end-to-end implementation of Deep Q-Learning in a challenging environment, demonstrating the agent's learning process and performance improvement over time. By leveraging neural networks and experience replay, the agent learns to land successfully in the Lunar Lander environment.
